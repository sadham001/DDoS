# DDoS Simulator üí£üìä

**A full-featured DDoS simulation tool with CLI dashboard, Layer 7 support, IP rotation, and real-time metrics.**

---

## üß† Overview

This project started as a basic socket-based DoS tester and has evolved into a robust **DDoS simulation tool** for educational and defensive testing purposes. The tool is designed to test and strengthen the resilience of networks, servers, web applications, and mitigation appliances against denial-of-service scenarios.

It includes support for:
- Tor/VPN/Proxy-based IP rotation
- Layer 7 (HTTP flood) mode
- Custom payloads
- Geo-filtering
- CAPTCHA bypass (placeholder)
- Multithreading
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- CPU overload protection
- Configurable threats, connections, and output logs

## üìä Live Metrics & Dashboard

While the tool is running, it provides live, real-time metrics displayed in the terminal. These metrics allow you to monitor the ongoing attack and performance of the system.

### Metrics Displayed:

- **Packets Sent**: The total number of packets sent during the attack.
- **Threads Running**: The number of active threads that are being used to send requests.
- **Active Connections**: The total number of established connections to the target.
- **Attack Status**: Whether the attack is in progress, paused, or completed.
- **Target IP and Port**: Displays the target IP address and port being attacked.
- **Current IP (If rotating)**: Shows the current IP being used if IP rotation is active (via Tor, VPN, or proxy).
- **CPU Usage (%)**: The percentage of CPU usage, especially useful if CPU overload protection (`--cpu-protect`) is enabled.

This real-time dashboard style helps you track attack progress and system performance, providing immediate feedback to help monitor and mitigate issues such as CPU overload or network strain.
## üìë Reporting

After the simulation completes, the tool can generate a detailed attack report. The report helps in analyzing the performance of the targeted systems and networks during the test.

### Available Reports:

- **Summary Report**: Includes overall stats, attack duration, total packets sent, and system performance (e.g., CPU usage, network utilization).
- **Detailed Attack Logs**: Provides detailed logs of each packet sent, the connections established, and any errors encountered during the simulation.
- **Metrics Breakdown**: A detailed breakdown of metrics such as packets sent per second, threads in operation, and connection success/fail rates.
- **Geo-Analysis**: Displays geo-located IPs involved in the attack, helping to understand the geographic distribution of the attack traffic (if geo-filtering was enabled).

### How to Enable Reporting:

To enable the generation of a report, use the `--report` flag when running the tool.

Example:
```bas
python ddos.py 192.168.1.100 80 --threads 100 --connections 500 --report
```
## üíæ Saving Configuration

The tool allows you to save your current configuration for reuse in future attacks. This is useful for consistent testing or to avoid reconfiguring options each time you run the tool.

### Save Configuration:

To save the current configuration, use the `--save-config` flag. This will save all your current settings to a `.config` file.

Example:
```bash
python ddos.py 192.168.1.100 80 --threads 100 --connections 500 --rotate-ip tor --save-config
```
This will save the configuration to a default file named ddos.config. You can specify a custom file name as well:
```bash
python ddos.py 192.168.1.100 80 --threads 100 --connections 500 --save-config --config my_config.config
```
This will load all the settings stored in my_config.config and apply them to the attack.

This feature helps automate the testing process and ensures you don‚Äôt need to manually set options every time you run the tool.
